# xfa-layout-engine

XFA layout engine — page break logic, positioning, content flow for XFA forms. **Experimental — part of the XFA stack.**

This crate is part of [PDFluent](https://pdfluent.com), a pure-Rust PDF SDK. Source: <https://github.com/pdfluent/pdfluent-sdk>.

**AGPL-3.0 or a commercial licence**, at your option — see the Licence section below.

## What it does

Computes the rendered layout of XFA forms: subform placement, page breaks, content reflow, table-row pagination, and overflow handling. Produces a layout tree consumed by the rendering pipeline.

## Status

Experimental — XFA support is under active development. See [`pdf-xfa`](https://crates.io/crates/pdf-xfa) for current status.

## Usage

Most users do not depend on this crate directly. Use the [`pdfluent`](https://crates.io/crates/pdfluent) facade.

## Licence

AGPL-3.0 or a commercial licence, at your option. The AGPL is the default and
the complete product: there is no licence key, no activation call and no tier,
and every feature works in every build. If you cannot accept the copyleft
obligation, the commercial licence is sold yearly and self-service at
[pdfluent.com/sdk/pricing](https://pdfluent.com/sdk/pricing), in four options: Commercial (per
organisation), OEM Startup and OEM (per product), and Priority support (an
add-on). The two texts are `LICENSE` and `LICENSE-COMMERCIAL` in this crate.
