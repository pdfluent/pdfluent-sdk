# pdf-annot

PDF annotation engine — typed access to all annotation types per ISO 32000-2 §12.5.

This crate is part of [PDFluent](https://pdfluent.com), a pure-Rust PDF SDK. Source: <https://github.com/pdfluent/pdfluent-sdk>.

**AGPL-3.0 or a commercial licence**, at your option — see the Licence section below.

## What it does

Reads, creates, and edits PDF annotations — text notes, highlights, underlines, squigglies, link annotations, popup notes, file attachments, and more. Provides typed accessors aligned with the ISO 32000-2 specification.

## Status

Reading annotations is complete for the types listed above. Creating and editing them covers the common types and is still growing.

## Usage

Most users do not depend on this crate directly. Use the [`pdfluent`](https://crates.io/crates/pdfluent) facade:

```rust
use pdfluent::prelude::*;
```

For low-level access, see <https://pdfluent.com/docs>.

## Licence

AGPL-3.0 or a commercial licence, at your option. The AGPL is the default and
the complete product: there is no licence key, no activation call and no tier,
and every feature works in every build. If you cannot accept the copyleft
obligation, the commercial licence is sold yearly and self-service at
[pdfluent.com/sdk/pricing](https://pdfluent.com/sdk/pricing), in four options: Commercial (per
organisation), OEM Startup and OEM (per product), and Priority support (an
add-on). The two texts are `LICENSE` and `LICENSE-COMMERCIAL` in this crate.
